# FraudShield â€” Credit Card Fraud Detection System

**FraudShield** is an AI-powered system designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning. The project handles class imbalance using **SMOTE**, applies robust preprocessing with **StandardScaler**, and trains models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** to identify suspicious activities in real time and prevent financial losses.

---

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions within highly imbalanced credit card data.  
It uses supervised learning and anomaly detection techniques to classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **legitimate**.  
The final trained model achieves high recall while maintaining precision to ensure minimal false alerts.

## How to Run the Project

### Option 1 â€” Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Open the notebook: `notebook/FraudShield_training.ipynb`
2. Upload `creditcard.csv` (or mount from Google Drive)
3. Run all cells sequentially  
4. Model and metrics will be generated and saved automatically

### Option 2 â€” Local Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/FraudShield-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System.git
cd FraudShield-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebook/FraudShield_training.ipynb
```
